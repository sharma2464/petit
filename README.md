# Petit

**Petit** (`app.petit.files`) is a fork of [Compressor](https://github.com/JoshAtticus/Compressor): a fast, ad-free, lightweight native video compressor for Android. Download builds from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sharma2464/petit/releases).

Lightning fast, ad free, super lightweight native video compressor for Android (inspired by the AMAZING Kompresso app for iOS).

## Performance
Below are four benchmarks of Compressor running on various devices. The baseline videos are available underneath all the benchmarks. All devices are running Compressor **1.6.3**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Testing Context & Methodology (v1.6.3 vs v1.5.2):**
> - **Thermal Conditions:** In the 1.5.2 benchmarks, devices were kept chilled in a cooler between runs. For 1.6.3, all tests were run at realistic **ambient room temperature (~21°C)** without active cooling to better reflect real-world use.
> - **Timing:** Timing was captured manually via stopwatch, so a small margin of error is expected.
> - **Comparison:** Comparisons against previous 1.5.2 results are included where the same device was re-tested.

*Why are the benchmarks different between versions?*
Between v1.5.2 and v1.6.3, the testing methodology shifted from keeping phones in a cooler between rounds to realistic ambient room temperature testing (~21°C). Additionally, timing was recorded manually via stopwatch so minor variations are expected. Despite ambient thermal loads, optimizations across newer versions show substantial improvements on heavy workloads (such as 8K & 4K decoding on Exynos chips and budget devices like the A05s).

*Why have some devices changed?*
New devices (Galaxy Z Flip6, ZTE Blade A73 5G, Oppo A5 2020, Nokia 7 plus, and the Google Pixel 1st Gen) were introduced to provide a broader view spanning modern flagships, budget 5G/4G SoCs, and older legacy hardware.
